          <p>
            Our project is an <strong>AI-powered Loan Approval Prediction System</strong>
            built with modern machine learning technologies. It helps financial
            institutions assess loan applications more efficiently by predicting
            approval status based on real-world financial indicators.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system is designed to be user-friendly, transparent, and
            scalable â€” integrating both frontend and backend technologies
            with a trained ML model to ensure fast, real-time predictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project was developed as a collaborative effort among three
            passionate developers, aiming to bring smart automation into the
            finance domain.
